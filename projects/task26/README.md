# Movie App

A simple React application with:
- Home, Movies, About, Contact pages
- Movies fetched from https://dummyjson.com/movies
- Movie detail page
- About page with a carousel
- Contact form that shows submitted data in a modal

## Setup

1. Extract the zip.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Note: This project uses a public dummy API (https://dummyjson.com). If you are offline or that API is unavailable, the Movies page may show empty results.
